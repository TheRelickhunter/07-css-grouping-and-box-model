                    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                    born
                    and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
                    explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.</p>


                <p class="lorem-paragraph">

                    No one <span class="dislike-adjectives">rejects</span>, <span class="dislike-adjectives">dislikes</span>, or <span class="dislike-adjectives">avoids</span> pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who
                    do not
                    know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
                </p>

                <h2>title for the second latest information</h2>
                <img title="second random image" src="https://picsum.photos/480/240?random=2">
                <p class="lorem-paragraph">
                    Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is
                    pain,
                    but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
                    pleasure.
                </p>
                <p class="lorem-paragraph">
                    To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain
                    some
                    advantage from it?
                </p>
            </article>
            <article id="category-3">
                <h2>title for the third latest information</h2>
                <img title="third random image" src="https://picsum.photos/480/240?random=3">
                <p class="lorem-paragraph">
                    But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
                    consequences,
                    one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
                </p>
                <p class="lorem-paragraph">
                    On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                    demoralized by
                    the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee.
